ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

We would be taking on the rock paper scissors project with the aim to develop a game where a player goes up against the server that is implemented by the group. The game would possess 3 symbols, rock paper and scissors which both the player and the server would be allowed to choose one of each. Each pick would occur once in a game of 3 rounds with each symbol having the ability to lose and beat another ex: paper covers rock, scissors cut paper and rock smashes scissors. We intend on using counter variables on the clients side of the project to count record the score to implement it in a best of three format.


FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMNETS

Users should be able to view and play the game in HTML format.

When the game starts each player should get prompted to enter a username (which would be used to announce the winner and record the high scored)

After entering a username it should prompt the first player to make a selection of either rock,paper or scissors after selecting the second player is prompted to do the same

If there is no second player the computer should make a random selection to be used against the player.

The selection the computer makes would change based on what selection the player makes most often (making the difficulty increase with more games played)

After each selection the program would display the selection of both players (or one player and the computer) and show who won that round.

Each game would consist of 3 rounds and so the player who wins the 2 out of 3 rounds wins the points, when the players tie they would get a point each (there would be 3 points per game).

There would be a scoreboard where the players can see who has gathered the most points the program must account for ties.(only the top 5 players would be recorded)

After the program displays the winner users should see an option where they can go back and start all over again

Users can play as many rounds as they like
